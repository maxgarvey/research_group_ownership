1. Start the shell, go to your maange.py
>>> python manage.py shell


2. Get the user

Either load one ...
>>> from django.contrib.auth import authenticate
>>> user = authenticate(username="johndoe", password="yourpw")

Or create one ...
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import User
>>> user = User.objects.create_user(username='johndoe', email="",  password="yourpw")
Django should silently automatically save it, and you should see it under Users in your admin page. But if you want save it yourself, do:
>>> user.is_staff = False
>>> user.save


3. Check the user's permissions
user.get_all_permissions()
or
user.user_permissions.all()


1. Start the shell, go to your maange.py
>>> python manage.py shell

2. Create the group
>>> from django.contrib.auth.models import Group
>>> group = Group(name="GroupName")
>>> group.save()

NOTE that Django pre-made permissions are only suggestions, they only go as far as their string names. YOU have to implement them if you want to use them.
